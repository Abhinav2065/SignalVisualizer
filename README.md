# Signal Visualizer!

This Project visualizes/simulates different types of Signals. It makes it easy to learn about these signals.

## The different signals visualized in this projects are:

1. **Digital Signal**
2. **Analog Signal**
   - Sine Wave
   - FM signal
3. **PWM Signal**
4. **Power Signal**
   - AC Signal
   - DC Signal

There is explanation of each graphs or simulations.
